        Welcome To LWC
        Lightning Web Components is a new programming model for building Lightning components.
        It uses web standards breakthroughs, can coexist and interoperate with the Aura programming model,
        and delivers unparalleled performance. To create and develop Lightning Web Components and
        use their powerful features and performance benefits,
        you need to set up Salesforce DX. For this Quick Start,
        you also use Visual Studio Code, which is the recommended code editor for developing on the Salesforce platform.
        Once your developer environment is ready,
        you learn how to write a simple Lightning web component and add it to a page in Lightning Experience.
